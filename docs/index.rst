AirQuant
========

AirQuant is an open source MATLAB software library for analysing macro tubular networks
in medical imaging such as airways.

Given segmentation/centreline of the tube anatomy it can interpret the structure,
extracting length measurements and interpolate the original image at perpendicular
planes to extract diameter measurements. Facilitating detailed quantitative
clinical analysis.
