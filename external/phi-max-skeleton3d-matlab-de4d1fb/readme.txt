Skeleton3D: Parallel medial axis thinning of a 3D binary volume

This code calculates the 3D medial axis skeleton of an arbitrary 3d binary volume. It is an optimized MATLAB implementation of the homotopic thinning algorithm described in [1]. We developed it to quantify the network of cell processes in bone [2], but it should work on images of any tubular or filamentous structures. An example volume (testvol.mat) is included, along with an example script (Test_Skeleton3D.m). Any comments, corrections or suggestions are highly welcome.

Usage:

skel = Skeleton3D(bin)

where "bin" is a 3D binary image, and "skel" the resulting image containing only the skeleton voxels, or

skel = Skeleton3D(bin,mask)

to mask all foreground voxels in 'mask' from skeletonization, e.g. to preserve certain structures in a image volume.

For additional cleanup, e.g. pruning of short branches, please use my Skel2Graph3D package on MATLAB File Exchange.

This code is inspired by the ITK implementation by Hanno Homann [3] and the Fiji/ImageJ plugin by Ignacio Arganda-Carreras [4]. If you include this in your own work, please cite our original publicaton [2].
